# Self Driving

## Mission

Tilt's mission is to map every theme to a basket of stocks for anyone to invest in. Mappings are AI generated and expert curated.
Expert improvements are accepted if they provide a better representation of a given theme.

## Theme Prompt
<!--[[[cog
import cog
import json
with open('config.json') as file:
  config = json.load(file)
  cog.outl(config['prompt'])
]]]-->
Self driving cars arrive before 2030, the world is not ready. Overall capital owners in transportation win, while labor loses. Companies selling, supplying, and marketing self driving cars will win. Companies dependent on drivers will win.
